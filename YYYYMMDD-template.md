## Summary ##

A one paragraph explanation of the feature/bug fix.

## Motivation ##

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome? (This section is otherwise known
as 'Advantages'.)

Please focus on explaining the motivation so that if this RFC is not accepted, the motivation could be used to develop
alternative solutions. In other words, enumerate the constraints you are trying to solve without coupling them too
closely to the solution you have in mind.

## Detailed design ##

This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody familiar with the project to
understand, and for somebody familiar with the implementation to implement. This should get into specifics and
corner-cases, and include examples of how the feature is used. Any new terminology should be defined here.

## Compatibility and Upgrade Path ##

State whether this feature is backwards compatible or not (in any way you can think of).

State whether this feature requires a specific upgrade path (e.g. a database patch).

If a specific upgrade path is required, detail whether there are any specific requirements needed if this feature lands
and is released. What is the upgrade path for current users of The Donatinator (if any)? Does anything need to be
performed manually, or can it be performed automatically during a version upgrade. How do we go about this?

## Drawbacks ##

Why should we **not** do this? Is it destructive (e.g. a database change which loses data)? Is it hard to implement?
Why would somebody **not** want this change?

Consider the impact on all the stakeholders in the project such as code contributors, docs contributors, users, and/or
donors. Consider how this might impact other existing and planned features.

Please consider the impact on teaching Ember, on the integration of this feature with other existing and planned
features, on the impact of the API churn on existing apps, etc.

There are tradeoffs to choosing any path, please attempt to identify them here.

## Alternatives ##

What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

This section could also include prior art, that is, how other web apps in the same domain have solved this problem.

## Unresolved questions ##

Optional, but suggested for first drafts. What parts of the design are still TBD?

## Further Information ##

State any information here that is pertinent to either reviewing this RFC or implementing it.

## Supporters ##

Mention any names and email addresses here of people you have already approached about this RFC and they are also happy
to put their weight behind it. Having none or some supporters here does not affect whether the RFC will be accepted,
but it does show you have asked for support from others, they have given it, and they can also be contacted by any
reviewers if any questions arise.
